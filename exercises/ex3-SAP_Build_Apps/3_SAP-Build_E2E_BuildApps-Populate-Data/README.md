# Populate Dropdown with Material Data from an SAP S/4HANA Cloud Backend

This tutorial shows you how to use SAP Build Apps to populate a dropdown field with SAP data, in this case with data from an SAP S/4HANA Cloud system.

## Script Overview

Previously, we created an input box for the user to enter a material ID for the sales order. Now, we want to make a call to an SAP S/4HANA Cloud backend, retrieve product data, and populate a dropdown box so the user can choose from a list of products.


> **Note:** Make sure to follow the exercise documentation and use the provided naming conventions. Otherwise, you will encounter issues.

- create a data source to SAP data
