For this workshop, we have already published your SAP Build Process Automation process to the SAP Build Library.

In order to trigger and consume processes from SAP Build Process Automation directly in SAP Build Apps, you need to set up the integration process.

   If you completed the **SAP Build Process Automation - Create a Sales Order Process** workshop, filter by the **Sales Orders Management XP262-XXX** (your user number) project before selecting the Process.
