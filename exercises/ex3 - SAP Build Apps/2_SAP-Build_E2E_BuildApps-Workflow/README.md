# Create SAP Build App to Trigger Workflow

This tutorial shows you how to use SAP Build Apps to create and stylize a simple, one-page app that triggers an SAP Build Process Automation workflow.

Specifically, the app lets the user enter sales order details and then send these to a process for approval. (In a real-world scenario, the sales order would then be created in S/4HANA Cloud, but that is not part of our flow.)

At the end of this unit, your app will look something like this:
